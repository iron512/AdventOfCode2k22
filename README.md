# AdventOfCode2k22

### YAAUR - Yet Another AdventOfCode Unifinished Repository

As a new december approaches, im going to start an advent of code, without finishing it ever.
We'll see how much I can keep up. This year I have been challenged by my dear [SvooF](https://github.com/SvevoF) to participate and possibly be more precise and active this year.

## Challenges
- Day0 is actually a problem from project euler. [Frazar](https://github.com/frazar) challenged me to solved as it bugged him for years. Here is the [link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67). Beyond the time to think about it, it took me 9 minutes to write the code (I used his shared knowledge and my hunch was very lucky tho).
- On Day0 I also produced a python quine.
- Solved Day01 on the train, from Trento to Mezzocorona. Still plenty of time on the railtrip to Egna.
- The day after Day1, one of my colleagues and I were talking about oneliners. So I decided to solve it again with an oneliner.
- On Day3 that same colleague showed me a *superclever* way to solve the character mapping. I definitely stoled it.
- Day6 was quite easy. Solved it from Trento to Lavis (even faster than Day1)
- in Day07 I also prompted a visualization of the asked directory. I had produced one too during the Operating System course, in 2017
- Day09 was quite tough. The abstraction i planned in the beginning however was quite correct. Big up.
- I really loved Day10. I love when the result displays some kinda of screen or whatever.
- Day11 was kinda fun. Not for the problem itself, but myself thinking that part 2 were soooo easy. After failing, I knew it was about the correct use of congruent classes and so on due to the constant use of module operation. but It took me some time to figure out a fast and reliable solution. It is crazy how much linear algebra taunts me every day
