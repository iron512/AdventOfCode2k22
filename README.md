# AdventOfCode2k22

### YAAUR - Yet Another AdventOfCode Unifinished Repository

As a new december approaches, im going to start an advent of code, without finishing it ever.
We'll see how much I can keep up. This year I have been challenged by my dear [SvooF](https://github.com/SvevoF) to participate and possibly be more precise and active this year.

## Challenges
- Day0 is actually a problem from project euler. [Frazar](https://github.com/frazar) challenged me to solved as it bugged him for years. Here is the [link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67). Beyond the time to think about it, it took me 9 minutes to write the code (I used his shared knowledge and my hunch was very lucky tho).
- On Day0 I also produced a python quine.
- Solved Day01 on the train, from Trento to Mezzocorona. Still plenty of time on the railtrip to Egna. Solution is nlogn, 14SLOC.
